# Project Title: Salary Prediction for Software Developers

## Overview:
This project is aimed at predicting salaries for software developers based on various factors such as their country of residence, level of education, and years of experience. The project uses data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020 and various Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning model development.

## Methodology:
The project uses the Jupyter Notebook environment to preprocess and analyze the data. Various data preprocessing techniques such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and handling missing values were employed. The cleaned and processed data was then used to build a machine learning model using Scikit-learn.

The model was trained on a subset of the data and tested on another subset to evaluate its performance. The model performance was measured using various evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared score. The model was also deployed using Streamlit to provide an interactive user interface.

## Results:
The machine learning model achieved a mean absolute error of 20,818.88 and an R-squared score of 0.37. The results indicate that the model can predict salaries for software developers with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The interactive user interface allows recruiters and employers to input various criteria to predict salaries for software developers based on their country, level of education, and years of experience.

## Conclusion:
The project provides valuable insights into predicting salaries for software developers based on various factors. The machine learning model can help recruiters and employers make informed decisions about salaries for software developers based on different criteria. The project also showcases various data preprocessing techniques and machine learning algorithms, which can be useful for other data science projects.
